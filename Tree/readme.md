# Tree

- A DS tree is a fundamental hierarchical data structure. It represents a collection of elements(data) called nodes, connected by edges(links) forming a tree-like structure.

# full Tree

- Each node either has no children (leaf node) or exactly two children.

# Perfect Tree : full + balance

- Balance: All the leaf nodes are at the same depth(distance from the root). This means the tree is completely filled with no gaps at any level.

# Complete Tree

- Almost Full Levels: All levels except possibly the last one are completely filled with nodes.
- Left leaning Last level: The last level is filled with nodes from the left side as much as possible. There might be empty spaces on the right.

# BST(Binary Search Tree)

- A BST is a special kind of binary tree used to organize data in a sorted way. It works like a filing cabinet where you can efficiently search, add or remove items.
