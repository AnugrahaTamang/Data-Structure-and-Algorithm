# Stack and Heap

1. What is the stack ?

- A stack is a linear data structure that follows LIFO(last in first out) principle.

2. What is the queue ?

- A queue is a linear data structure that functions like a waiting line. It follows the FIFO(first in first out) principle, meaning the element that enters the queue first will be the first one to be removed.
