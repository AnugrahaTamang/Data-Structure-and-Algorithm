#Non-Linear Data Structures

- Data elements are not arranged in a sequential manner and can form a hierarchy.
- Examples:
  - **Tree**: A hierarchical structure where each node has a parent and children.
    - Example: Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, etc.
  - **Graph**: A set of nodes connected by edges.
    - Example: Directed Graph, Undirected Graph, Weighted Graph, etc.
