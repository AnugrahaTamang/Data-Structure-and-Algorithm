#Linear Data Structures

- Data elements are arranged in a sequential order.
- Examples:
  - **Array**: A collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations.
  - **Linked List**: A sequence of nodes where each node points to the next.
  - **Stack**: A collection following the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.
  - **Queue**: A collection following the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.
